# Little-Taco-Shop-

- The Little Taco Shop is my website  number 2 that I am working on(practice : Using freeCodeCamp.org)

- I used 3 images in the 3 pages and saved them into the images folder.

- There are 3 main pages for this web page which are index.html , hours.html , and contact.html

- I used a little bit CSS in this process because I don't know much about CSS yet and I saved it style.css in the css folder .
  
  we need to link this file into the html files .

- We added taco emojis in this page , with using (Emojipedia) = (https://emojipedia.org/taco/).
